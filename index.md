This blog is all about learning perl the hard way. Before we take the first step towards learning perl programming there are few questions that needs to be answered.

1. What is perl?

    Perl stands for __Practical Extraction and Reporting Language__ or sometimes even referred to as __Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister__. Anyways Larry endorses both the abbreviations. Perl is the result of a lazy developer who needed a neat and clean programming language, which is easy to code and has powerful features like _grep_, _regex_, _awk_ etc support.

2. Do you need perl?

    Perl is best suited for    
    - UNIX System Administration.    
    - Network prototyping.    
    - CGI Scripting.    
    - When working with large text files.  <br/><br/>


3. How should I get started with perl?

    A large number of online tutorials are available on the web to get started with perl programming. Oreilly books like _Learning Perl_, _Intermediate Perl_ and _Programming Perl_ are some of the best books available if you are a Bibliophile. Perl is available in almost all the Unix and Mac operating systems. _Cygwin_, _active perl_ and _strawberry perl_ are the options for windows users to work with perl.
