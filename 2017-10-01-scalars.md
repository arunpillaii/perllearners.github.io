## Scalar Data otherwise Scalars

Scalars, the first of the 3 most used data structure in perl which deals mostly with numbers and strings. Scalar variables are represented with '$'(dollar or sigil) sign. They are also used are references to other data structures like arrays/hash. 


A scalar value can be acted upon by [operators](#operators) which results in a scalar variable. Scalar variables can be used while reading data from files, parsing command line arguments from scripts, database handlers, references to other data structures and more. 


### Numbers

Numbers are categorized as 
- integers
- floating point

Perl support integers and floating point types. However it is interesting when it comes to how perl stores an **integer** type. Internal to perl integer types are stored as double precision floating point values. However this is not visible for the programmer and something not to be worried much since interpreter takes care of the conversions without compromising the speed.

**Floating point** types also known as floating point literals are integer types with decimal point precision. These include numbers with and without decimal digits, and exponents with power of 10 usually represented with 'e' (Exponents).

```
use strict;                              (1)
use warnings;                            (2)

my $variable = 10;                       (3)
my $floating_point_variable = 100.97;    (4)
my $exponential_variable = 10e10         (5)
```

1. `use strict` is a definite import since this module impose some of the strict rules for perl programming. It will abort the program with errors if the rules are not followed.

2. `use warnings` helps you in finding typing mistakes in the program. Some of the examples would be missing a semi colon, typo like using 'elseif/elif' instead of 'elsif'.

3. Integer declaration.
4. Floating point declaration.
5. Exponential variables otherwise tacking to the power of 10.


### Non Decimal Integer
Number system in mathematics/digital electronics mainly talks about

- **Binary:** Number system represented to the base '2' is called a binary number system. They are typically represented in '0' an '1'.

- **Decimal:** Most commonly used and what we use regularly is categorized under the decimal system. 

- **Octal:** Octal system use the base of '8' to define the numbers. Decimal number '80' in octal system can be represented as `1 * 8**2 + 1* 8**1 + 8 *8**0` which equates to `118`.

- **Hexadecimal:** It is a positional number system with the base of '16'. They are mostly used by computer system designers and embedded system programmers. These are usually used to represent the bit patterns used by Microprocessors.


### Operators

Similar to the other programming languages perl also supports mathemetical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Apart from these normal operations perl also supports modulus operator.
