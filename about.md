**About Effective Perl**

Effective perl is an attempt to build a quick reference of perl programming. In the course of building the material we would also talk about some of the real world scenarios where we could use perl effectively. We will also have some practice programs during the course as an attempt to solve and learn the ways to do it.


You can share your ideas to the [site moderator](pl.bglr@gmail.com). Enough of talking and lets get back to work... 


*Happy learning... Happy coding...*
